BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).


You can directly run the Server by running/clicking the Server.jar file inside this folder without running
it in the command line. Source files of this project is located under 'src' folder.
